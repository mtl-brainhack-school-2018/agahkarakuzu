Packaging and Deploying mt_sat_batch

1. Prerequisites for Deployment 

A. If MATLAB Runtime version 9.1 (R2016b) has not been installed, install it in one of 
   these ways:

i. Run the package installer, which will also install the MATLAB Runtime.

ii. Download the Linux 64-bit version of the MATLAB Runtime for R2016b from:

    http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html
   
iii. Run the MATLAB Runtime installer provided with MATLAB.

B. Verify that a Linux 64-bit version of Python 2.7, 3.3, and/or 3.4 is installed.

2. Installing the mt_sat_batch Package

A. Go to the directory that contains the file setup.py and the subdirectory mt_sat_batch. 
   If you do not have write permissions, copy all its contents to a temporary location 
   and go there.

B. Execute the command:

    python setup.py install [options]
    
If you have full administrator privileges, and install to the default location, you do 
   not need to specify any options. Otherwise, use --user to install to your home folder, 
   or --prefix="installdir" to install to "installdir". In the latter case, add 
   "installdir" to the PYTHONPATH environment variable. For details, refer to:

    https://docs.python.org/2/install/index.html

C. Copy the following to a text editor:

setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:<MCR_ROOT>/v90/runtime/glnxa64:<MCR_ROOT>/v90/bin/glnxa64:<MCR_ROOT>/v90/sys/os/glnxa64:<MCR_ROOT>/v90/sys/opengl/lib/glnxa64
setenv XAPPLRESDIR <MCR_ROOT>/v90/X11/app-defaults

Make the following changes:
- If LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not yet defined, remove the string "${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:". 
- Replace "<MCR_ROOT>" with the directory where the MATLAB Runtime is installed.
- If your shell does not support setenv, use a different command to set the environment 
   variables.

Finally, execute the commands or add them to your shell initialization file.

3. Using the mt_sat_batch Package

The mt_sat_batch package is on your Python path. To import it into a Python script or 
   session, execute:

    import mt_sat_batch

If a namespace must be specified for the package, modify the import statement accordingly.
